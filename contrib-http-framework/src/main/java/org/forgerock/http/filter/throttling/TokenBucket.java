/**
 * A TokenBucket is an helper class that aims to limit the output rate. Each ticker the method {@link #tryConsume()} is
 * called, a token is removed from the bucket. Where there is no token anymore into the bucket then the returned value
 * is the ticker to wait for the availability of the token. An attempt to refill the bucket as much as possible, is done
 * prior any token consumption. That is a variant of the Leaky Bucket algorithm, used in network traffic shaping.
 *
 * You may use it like this to limit the number of calls to your API :
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * Ticker ticker = ...
 * // We want to limit to maximum 10 calls per seconds
 * TokenBucket bucket = new TokenBucket(ticker, 10, Duration.duration("1 seconds"));
 *
 * // Then you use it like this :
 * public long doSomething() throws Exception {
 *   long delay = bucket.tryConsume();
 *   if (delay <= 0) {
 *     // You succeeded to consume a token, then you do the job
 *     return fetchCountFromDatabase();
 *   } else {
 *     // You did not succeed to consume a token, then you have 2 choices :
 *     //  - either you give up
 *     //  - or you wait for the delay and try again
 *     // Here we will try again after sleeping a bit :
 *     TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS.sleep(delay);
 *     return doSomething();
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
