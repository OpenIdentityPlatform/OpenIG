   <p>
   The ForgeRock Identity Gateway is a high-performance reverse proxy server
   with specialized session management and credential replay functionality.
   The Identity Gateway supports OpenAM or any existing web access management
   system. With either method, there is no need to modify the target
   application or the container that it runs in.
