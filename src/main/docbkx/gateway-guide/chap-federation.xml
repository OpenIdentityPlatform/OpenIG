 <title>${projectName} as a SAML 2.0 Service Provider</title>

 <para>
  This chapter has two aims.
  First, it aims to help you understand how
  ${projectName} works as a SAML 2.0 service provider,
  and what that entails in terms of setup and configuration.
  Second, it aims to show you how to configure ${projectName}
  as a SAML 2.0 federation service provider,
  logging users in to a protected application
  with information from a SAML assertion.

  <title>About SAML 2.0 Federation</title>

  <para>
   The Federation component of ${projectName} is
   a standards based authentication service used by ${projectName}
   to validate a user and retrieve key attributes of the user
   in order to log them in to applications that ${projectName} protects.
   The Federation component implements Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0.
  </para>

  <para>
   Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 is a standard
   for exchanging security information across organizational boundaries.
   SAML 2.0 enables web single sign-on (SSO), for example,
   where the service managing the user's identity
   does not necessarily belong to the same organization
   and does not necessarily use the same software
   as the service that the user wants to access.
  </para>

  <para>
   In SAML 2.0, the service managing the user's identity
   is called the <firstterm>Identity Provider</firstterm> (IDP).
   The service that the user wants to access
   is called the <firstterm>Service Provider</firstterm> (SP).
   Provider organizations agree on the security information they want to exchange,
   and then they mutually configure access to each others' services,
   so that the SAML 2.0 federation capability is ready for use.
   The group of providers sets up a <firstterm>circle of trust</firstterm>,
   which is a list of services participating in the federation.
   In order to be able to configure access to services in the circle of trust,
   the providers share SAML 2.0 <firstterm>metadata</firstterm>
   describing their services in an XML format defined by the SAML 2.0 standard.
  </para>

  <para>
   ${projectName} plays the role of SAML 2.0 SP.
   You must therefore configure ${projectName} as SP to access IDP services
   in order for the Federation component to be operational.
  </para>

  <para>
   For SAML 2.0 web SSO, the user authenticates with the IDP.
   This can start either with the user visiting the IDP site and logging in,
   or with the user visiting the SP site and being directed to the IDP to log in.
   On successful authentication, the IDP sends
   an assertion statement about the authentication to the SP.
   This assertion statement attests which user the IDP authenticated,
   when the authentication succeeded, how long the assertion is valid, and so forth.
   It can optionally contain attribute values for the user who authenticated.
   (${projectName} can then, for example, use the attribute values
   to log a user into a protected application.)
   The assertion can optionally be signed and encrypted.
  </para>

  <orderedlist>
   <para>
    There are two ways that the ${projectName} federation component can be invoked:
   </para>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     IDP initiated SSO,
     where the remote Identity Provider sends
     an unsolicited authentication statement to ${projectName}
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     SP initiated SSO,
     where ${projectName} calls the Federation component to
     initiate federated SSO with the Identity Provider
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </orderedlist>

  <para>
   In both cases, the job of the Federation component is
   to validate the user
   and to pass the required attributes to ${projectName}
   so that it can log the user into protected applications.

  <indexterm>
   <primary>Configuration</primary>
   <secondary>Federation</secondary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   The simplest way to configure the Federation component
   is to use the OpenAM task wizard to generate a Fedlet,
   and then copy the Fedlet configuration files to the correct locations.
   If you use the Fedlet configuration files,
   simply unpack <filename>Fedlet.war</filename>
   and copy all the files listed above into <filename>${warSamlDir}</filename>.
   You do not have to modify the files
   to do basic IDP and SP initiated SSO with ${projectName}.
   When generating a Fedlet,
   know that the sample <filename>config.json</filename> templates
   uses <literal>/saml</literal> as the URI
   so your Fedlet end point should be specified as
   <literal><replaceable>protocol</replaceable>://<replaceable
    >host</replaceable>.<replaceable>domain</replaceable>:<replaceable
    >port</replaceable>/saml</literal>.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you do not use the Fedlet wizard,
   edit the configuration files for the unconfigured Fedlet,
   and then copy the Fedlet configuration files
   to the <filename>${warSamlDir}</filename> directory.
   You must still nevertheless get the metadata from the IDP,
   and then copy it to <filename>idp.xml</filename> in the same directory.
  </para>

  <para>
   Once you have the Fedlet configuration files set up, add the
   <link
    xlink:show="new"
    xlink:href="reference#SamlFederationHandler"
    xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"
   >SamlFederationHandler</link> object to the ${projectName} configuration.

   Application <literal>myportal</literal> requires a form

   The password for <literal>myportal</literal>

  <para>
   The incoming SAML2 assertion sent by the Identity Provider contains
   the <literal>mail</literal> and <literal>mailPassword</literal> attributes.
   The Federation component validates the incoming assertion,

  <title>Preparing to Try ${projectName} as a SAML 2.0 Service Provider</title>

  <para>
   The following sections in this chapter are a tutorial on setting up
   OpenAM to send a SAML 2.0 assertion to ${projectName} containing user credentials,
   and ${projectName} to validate the assertion and use the credentials
   to log the user in to the protected application.
  </para>

  <para>
   Before you start this tutorial,
   prepare ${projectName} and the minimal HTTP server as you did for the chapter on
  <link

   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"
   ><citetitle>Getting Started</citetitle></link>.
  </para>

  <para>
   ${projectName} should be running in Jetty,
   configured to access the minimal HTTP server as described in that chapter.
  </para>

  <para>
   The initial ${projectName} configuration file should look like the one used
   to proxy requests through to the HTTP server
   and to capture request and response data, as you used in the chapter on
   <link

  </para>

  <para>
   To test your setup, access the HTTP server home page through ${projectName} at
   <link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="http://www.example.com:8080" />.
   Login as username <literal>george</literal>, password <literal>costanza</literal>.
   You should see a page showing the username and some information about the request.
  </para>

  <para>
   In this tutorial, it is assumed that you are familiar
   with SAML 2.0 federation and with the components involved, including OpenAM.
   For OpenAM documentation, see
   <link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="http://docs.forgerock.org/en/openam/" />.

 <section xml:id="fed-tutorial-configure-openam">
  <title>Configuring OpenAM</title>

  <para>
   Install and configure OpenAM on
   <literal>http://openam.example.com:8088/openam</literal>
   with the default configuration.
   If you use a different configuration,
   make sure you substitute in the tutorial accordingly.
  </para>

  <para>
   Login to the OpenAM console as administrator,
   and use the common task wizard to create a hosted Identity Provider.
   This tutorial does not address PKI configuration for validation and encryption,
   though ${projectName} is capable of handling both when properly configured,
   just as any OpenAM Fedlet can handle both.
   Configure the Attribute Mapping to map the
   the <literal>mail</literal> attribute to <literal>mail</literal>
   and the <literal>employeenumber</literal> attribute to <literal>employeenumber</literal>.
   You can use the <literal>test</literal> certificate
   in the Identity Provider configuration for signing in this example.
  </para>

  <para>
   Then use the common task wizard to create a Fedlet.
   Set the Name to <literal>${projectName}</literal>.
   Set the Destination URL to <literal>http://www.example.com:8080/saml</literal>.
   Also configure the Attribute Mapping for the Fedlet to map the
   the <literal>mail</literal> attribute to <literal>mail</literal>
   and the <literal>employeenumber</literal> attribute to <literal>employeenumber</literal>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Why map these attributes?
   The SAML 2.0 attribute mapping indicates that the SP, ${projectName},
   wants the IDP, OpenAM in this case,
   to get the values of these attributes from the user profile
   and then send them to the SP, ${projectName}.
   ${projectName} can then use the values of the attributes,
   in this case <literal>mail</literal> and <literal>employeenumber</literal>,
   to log the user in to the application it protects.
  </para>

  <para>
   This tutorial uses <literal>mail</literal>
   and <literal>employeenumber</literal>
   for the sake of simplicity.
   Both of those attributes are part of a user's profile
   out of the box with the default OpenAM configuration.
   Neither of the attributes are needed for anything else in this tutorial.
   So this tutorial uses <literal>mail</literal> to hold the username,
   and <literal>employeenumber</literal> to hold the password.
   In a real deployment, you would no doubt use other attributes
   that depend on how the real user profiles are configured.
  </para>

   Use the OpenAM console to create a user subject in the top level realm
   with Email Address <literal>george</literal>
   and Employee Number <literal>costanza</literal>.

      Notice the following features of the new route.

     <listitem>
      <para>
       The "DispatchHandler" dispatches requests
       to the "StaticResponseHandler"
       if the username has not yet been populated in the exchange,
       meaning the user has not yet authenticated with the IDP.
       Otherwise, if the credentials have been inserted into the exchange,
       the "DispatchHandler" dispatches requests
       to the "Chain" to log the user in to the protected application.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       The "StaticResponseHandler" redirects
       to the Service Provider initiated single sign-on end point
       to initiate SAML 2.0 web browser SSO.
       After authentication is successful
       and the "SamlFederationHandler" has injected credentials into the exchange,
       the user-agent ends up redirected to this same route.
      </para>

      <para>
       If more dynamic control is needed for
       the URL where the user agent is redirected,
       then use the <literal>RelayState</literal> query string parameter
       in the URL of the redirect Location header.
       The <literal>RelayState</literal> query string parameter specifies
       where to redirect the user
       when the SAML 2.0 web browser SSO process is complete.
       The <literal>RelayState</literal> overrides the "redirectURI"
       set in the "SamlFederationHandler".
       The <literal>RelayState</literal> value must be URL encoded.
       When using an expression, use the <literal>urlEncode()</literal> function
       to encode the value.
       For example: <literal>${urlEncode(exchange.originalUri)}</literal>.
       In the following example, the user is finally redirected
       to the original URI from the request:

     <listitem>
      <para>
       The "StaticRequestFilter" retrieves
       the username and password from the exchange
       and replaces your browser's original HTTP GET request
       with an HTTP POST login request
       that contains the credentials to authenticate.

   What is happening behind the scenes?
  </para>

  <para>
   The initial incoming requests matches the <literal>/federate</literal> route.
   As the user is not yet authenticated,
   the "SPInitiatedSSORedirectHandler" sends a redirect to initiate SSO.
  </para>

  <para>
   The user authenticates with the Identity Provider for SAML 2.0 single sign-on.
   After authentication, the Identity Provider redirects the user-agent back to
   the SAML URI on the Service Provider (${projectName}),
   which you configured for the Fedlet as <literal>/saml</literal>.
   The "SamlFederationHandler" gets the request to this route.
   The request holds the SAML 2.0 assertion whose attributes contain credentials.
  </para>

  <para>
   The "SamlFederationHandler" processes an incoming SAML 2.0 assertion,
   injecting credentials values from the assertion into the exchange session.
   The "SamlFederationHandler" then redirects
   to the <literal>/federate</literal> route.
  </para>

  <para>
   On the <literal>/federate</literal> route,
   once the attributes from the assertion are set in the session,
   ${projectName} dispatches the exchange to the "Chain".
   The "StaticRequestFilter" in the "Chain"
   uses the attribute values to replace the request
   with an HTTP POST of login form data
   to log the user in to the protected application.

   ${projectName} returns the response page showing that the user has logged in.
