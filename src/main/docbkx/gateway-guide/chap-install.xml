  <section xml:id="about-securing-connections">
   <title>About Securing Connections</title>

   <para>
    ${projectName} is often deployed to replay credentials
    or other security information.
    In a real world deployment,
    that information must be communicated over a secure connection using HTTPS,
    meaning in effect HTTP over encrypted Transport Layer Security (TLS).
    Never send real credentials, bearer tokens, or other security information
    unprotected over HTTP.
   </para>

   <para>
    When ${projectName} is acting as a server,
    the web application container where ${projectName} runs
    is responsible for setting up TLS connections
    with client applications that connect to ${projectName}.
    For details, see <xref linkend="jetty-https" />
    or <xref linkend="tomcat-https" />.
   </para>

   <para>
    When ${projectName} is acting as a client, the
    <link
     xlink:show="new"
     xlink:href="reference#HttpClient"
     xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"
    >HttpClient</link> configuration sets up TLS connections
    from ${projectName} to other servers.
    For details, see <xref linkend="client-side-security" />.
   </para>

   <para>
    TLS depends on the use of digital certificates (public keys).
    In typical use of TLS,
    the client authenticates the server by its X.509 digital certificate
    as the first step to establishing communication.
    Once trust is established,
    then the client and server can set up
    a symmetric key to encrypt communications.
   </para>

   <para>
    In order for the client to trust the server certificate,
    the client needs first to trust
    the certificate of the party who signed the server's certificate.
    This means that either the client
    has a trusted copy of the signer's certificate,
    or the client has a trusted copy
    of the certificate of the party who signed the signer's certificate.
   </para>

   <para>
    Certificate Authorities (CAs) are trusted signers
    with well-known certificates.
    Browsers generally ship with many well-known CA certificates.
    Java distributions also ship with many well-known CA certificates.
    Getting a certificate signed by a well-known CA generally costs money.
   </para>

   <para>
    It is also possible for you to self-sign certificates.
    The trade off is that although you do not have to pay any money,
    the certificate is not trusted by any clients until they have a copy.
    Whereas it is often enough
    to install a certificate signed by a well-known CA
    in the server key store as the basis of trust for HTTPS connections,
    self-signed certificates must also be installed in all clients.
   </para>

   <para>
    Like self-signed certificates,
    the signing certificates of less well-known CAs
    are also unlikely to be found in the default trust store.
    You might therefore need to install those signing certificates
    on the client side as well.
   </para>

   <para>
    This guide describes how to install self-signed certificates,
    which are certainly fine for trying out the software
    and okay for deployments where you manage all clients
    that access ${projectName}.
    If you need a well-known CA signed certificate instead,
    see the documentation for your container for details
    on requesting a CA signature and installing the CA signed certificate.
   </para>

   <para>
    Once certificates are properly installed to allow client-server trust,
    also consider the cipher suites configured for use.
    The cipher suite used determines the security settings for the communication.
    Initial TLS negotiations bring the client and server to agreement on which
    cipher suite to use.
    Basically the client and server share their preferred cipher suites
    to compare and to choose.
    If you therefore have a preference concerning the cipher suites to use,
    you must set up your container to use only your preferred cipher suites.
    Otherwise the container is likely to inherit the list of cipher suites
    from the underlying Java environment.
   </para>

   <para>
    The Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE), part of the Java environment,
    provides security services that ${projectName} uses to secure connections.
    You can set security and system properties to configure the JSSE.
    For a list of properties you can use to customize the JSSE in Oracle Java,
    see the <citetitle>Customization</citetitle> section of the

   </para>

   <para>
    Configure Tomcat to use the same protocol
    as the application you are protecting with ${projectName}.
    If the protected application is on a remote system,
    configure Tomcat to use the same port as well.
    If your application listens on both an HTTP and an HTTPS port,
    then you must configure Tomcat to do so as well.
   </para>

   <para>
    To configure Tomcat to use an HTTP port other than 8080,
    modify the defaults in <filename>/path/to/tomcat/conf/server.xml</filename>.
    Search for the default value of 8080 and replace it with the new port number.
   </para>

   <section xml:id="tomcat-cookie-domains">
    <title>Configuring Tomcat Cookie Domains</title>

    <para>
     If you use ${projectName} for more than a single protected application
     and the protected applications are on different hosts,
     then you must configure Tomcat to set domain cookies.
     To do this, add a session cookie domain context element
     that specifies the domain to
     <filename>/path/to/conf/Catalina/<replaceable>server</replaceable>/root.xml</filename>,
     as in the following example.
    </para>

  <title>Preparing For Load Balancing &amp; Failover</title>

  <para>
   For a high scale or highly available deployment,
   you can prepare a pool of ${projectName} servers
   with nearly identical configurations,
   and then load balance requests across the pool,
   routing around any servers that become unavailable.
   Load balancing allows the service to handle more load.
  </para>

  <para>
   Before you spread requests across multiple servers, however,
   you must determine what to do with state information
   that ${projectName} saves in the exchange,
   or retrieves locally from the ${projectName} server system.
   If information is retrieved locally,
   then also consider setting up failover
   so that if one server becomes unavailable,
   another server in the pool can take its place.
   The benefit of failover is
   that a server failure can be invisible to client applications.

   By default the exchange data resides in memory in the container
   where ${projectName} runs.
   This includes the default session implementation,
   which is backed by the HttpSession that the container handles.
   You can opt to store session data on the user-agent instead, however.
   For details and to consider whether your data fits, see
   <link
    xlink:href="reference#JwtSession"
    xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"
    xlink:show="new"
   >JwtSession</link>.
   When you use the <literal>JwtSession</literal> implementation,
   be sure to share the encryption keys across all servers,
   so that any server can read session cookies from any other.
  </para>

  <para>
   If your data does not fit in an HTTP cookie,
   for example because when encrypted it is larger than 4 KB,
   consider storing a reference in the cookie,
   and then retrieve the data by using another filter.
   ${projectName} logs warning messages if the JwtSession cookie is too large.
   Using a reference can also work when a server becomes unavailable,
   and the load balancer must fail requests over to another server in the pool.
  </para>

  <para>
   If some data attached to an exchange must be stored on the server side,
   then you have additional configuration steps to perform
   for session stickiness and for session replication.
   Session stickiness means that the load balancer sends all requests
   from the same client session to the same server.
   Session stickiness helps to ensure that a client request goes
   to the server holding the original session data.
   Session replication involves writing session data
   either to other servers or to a data store,
   so that if one server goes down,
   other servers can read the session data and continue processing.
   Session replication helps when one server fails,
   allowing another server to take its place
   without having to start the session over again.
   If you set up session stickiness but not session replication,
   when a server crashes the client session information for that server is lost,
   and the client must start again with a new session.
  </para>

  <para>
   How you configure session stickiness and session replication
   depends on your load balancer and on your container.

 <section xml:id="client-side-security">
  <title>Configuring ${projectName} For HTTPS (Client-Side)</title>

  <para>
   For ${projectName} to connect to a server securely over HTTPS,
   ${projectName} must be able to trust the server.
   The default settings rely on the Java environment trust store
   to trust server certificates.
   The Java environment default trust store includes
   public key signing certificates
   from many well-known Certificate Authorities (CAs).
   If all servers present certificates signed by these CAs,
   then you have nothing to configure.
  </para>

  <para>
   If however the server certificates are self-signed
   or signed by a CA whose certificate is not trusted out of the box,
   then you can configure a
   <link
    xlink:show="new"
    xlink:href="reference#KeyStore"
    xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"
   >KeyStore</link>,

    xlink:show="new"
    xlink:href="reference#TrustManager"
    xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"
   >TrustManager</link>,
   and optionally a
   <link
    xlink:show="new"
    xlink:href="reference#KeyManager"
    xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"

   <link
    xlink:show="new"
    xlink:href="reference#HttpClient"
    xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"
   >HttpClient</link>
   to enable ${projectName} to trust servers when acting as a client.
  </para>

  <para>
   The KeyStore holds the servers' certificates or the CA signing certificate.
   The TrustManager allows ${projectName} to handle the certificates
   in the KeyStore when deciding whether to trust a server certificate.
   The optional KeyManager allows ${projectName} to present its certificate
   from the key store when the server must authenticate ${projectName} as client.
   The HttpClient references whatever TrustManager and KeyManager you configure.
  </para>

  <para>
   You can configure each of these either globally for the ${projectName} server,
   of locally for a particular ClientHandler configuration.
  </para>

  <para>
   The Java KeyStore holds the peer servers' public key certificates
   (and optionally the ${projectName} certificate and private key).
   For example, suppose you have a certificate file, <filename>ca.crt</filename>,
   that holds the trusted signer's certificate
   of the CA who signed the server certificates
   of the servers in your deployment.
   In that case, you could import the certificate into a Java Key Store file,
   <filename>/path/to/keystore.jks</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>
   You could then configure the following "KeyStore" for ${projectName}
   that holds the trusted certificate.
