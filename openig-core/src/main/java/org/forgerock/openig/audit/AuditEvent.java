/**
 * An AuditEvent represents a point in time during the processing of an Exchange.

 * Instances of this class are <b>not thread-safe</b>: any filter can possibly update the {@link Exchange} while
 * processing the audit event. Special care must be taken when dealing with the Exchange.
 * <p>
 * The {@literal source} property helps to identify the object that emitted the notification.
 * The {@literal timestamp} property gives a time marker to keep events organized in a
 * sequential manner (expressed in milliseconds).
 * The {@literal exchange} property gives a pointer to the captured {@link Exchange} (never {@code null}). There is
 * no way to guarantee, if the notification is processed in an asynchronous way, that the exchange content was not
 * modified in the meantime.
 * The {@literal tags} property helps to qualify this notification (no duplicated values).
