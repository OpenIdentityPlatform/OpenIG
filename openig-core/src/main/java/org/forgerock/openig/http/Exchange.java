/**
 * An HTTP exchange of request and response, and the root object for the exchange object model.
 * The exchange object model parallels the document object model, exposing elements of the
 * exchange. It supports this by exposing its fixed attributes and allowing arbitrary
 * attributes via its {@code ExtensibleFieldMap} superclass.
 * <p/>
 * The contract of an exchange is such that it is the responsibility of the caller of a
 * {@link Handler} object to create and populate the request object, and responsibility of the
 * handler to create and populate the response object.
 * <p/>
 * If an existing response object exists in the exchange and the handler intends to replace
 * it with another response object, it must first check to see if the existing response
 * object has an entity, and if it does, must call its {@code close} method in order to signal
 * that the processing of the response from a remote server is complete.
