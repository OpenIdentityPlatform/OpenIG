 * A chain of exchange zero or more filters and one handler. The chain is responsible for
 * dispatching the exchange to each filter in the chain, and finally the handler.
 * <p>
 * When a chain dispatches an exchange to a filter, it creates a "subchain" (a subset of this
 * chain, which contains the remaining downstream filters and handler), and passes it as a
 * parameter to the filter. For this reason, a filter should make no assumptions or
 * correlations using the chain it is supplied with when invoked.
 * <p>
 * A filter may elect to terminate dispatching of the exchange to the rest of the chain by not
 * calling {@code chain.handle(exchange)} and generate its own response or dispatch to a
 * completely different handler.
