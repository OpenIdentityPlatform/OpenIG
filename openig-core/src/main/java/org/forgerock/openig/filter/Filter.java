     * Filters the request and/or response of an exchange. Initially, {@code exchange.request}

     * This method may elect not to pass the request to the next filter or handler, and instead
     * handle the request itself. It can achieve this by merely avoiding a call to
     * {@code next.handle(exchange)} and creating its own response object the exchange. The
     * filter is also at liberty to replace a response with another of its own after the call
     * to {@code next.handle(exchange)}.

     * <strong>Important note:</strong> If an existing response exists in the exchange object
     * and the filter intends to replace it with its own, it must first check to see if the
     * existing response has an entity, and if it does, must call its {@code close} method in
     * order to signal that the processing of the response from a remote server is complete.
     *
     * @param exchange the exchange containing the request and response to filter.

     * @throws HandlerException if an exception occurred handling the exchange.
     * @throws IOException if an I/O exception occurred.
