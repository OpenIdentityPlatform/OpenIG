  <title>Decorators</title>

  <partintro>
   <para>
    Decorators are objects that decorate other heap objects,
    adding the new behavior that the decorator provides.
    For example, you can configure a decorator object
    for capturing requests and responses to a file
    and then decorate other objects in the heap
    to trigger the capture.
   </para>

   <para>
    To decorate other objects individually, use a local decoration
    by adding the decorator's "name" value as a top-level field of the object.
    For example, suppose a capture decorator named "capture" is defined
    in the global configuration, <filename>config.json</filename>.
    The decorator is configured to capture the entity but not the exchange.
   </para>

   <programlisting language="javascript">
{
    "name": "capture",
    "type": "CaptureDecorator",
    "config": {
        "captureEntity": true,
        "_captureExchange": true
    }
}
   </programlisting>

   <para>
    The following "ClientHandler" configuration would then capture requests
    including the entity before they are forwarded to the server.
   </para>

   <programlisting language="javascript">
{
    "name": "ClientHandler",
    "type": "ClientHandler",
    "capture": "request"
}
   </programlisting>

   <para>
    To decorate the "handler" for a route,
    add the decorator as a top-level field of the route.
    The following route includes an audit decoration on the "handler".
    This configuration decorates the "ClientHandler" only for the current route.
    It does not decorate other uses of "ClientHandler" in other routes.
   </para>

   <programlisting language="javascript">
{
    "handler": "ClientHandler",
    "audit": "Default route"
}
   </programlisting>

   <para>
    The decoration as a top-level field also does not decorate "heap" objects.
    To decorate all applicable objects defined within a Route's heap,
    configure "globalDecorators" as a top-level field of the Route.
    The "globalDecorators" field takes a map of the decorations to apply.
    For example, the following route has "audit" and "capture" decorations
    that apply to the "Chain", "HeaderFilter", and "StaticResponseHandler".
    In other words, the decorations apply to all objects in this route's heap.
   </para>

   <programlisting language="javascript">
{
    "globalDecorators": {
        "audit": "My static route",
        "capture": "all"
    },
    "handler": {
        "type": "Chain",
        "config": {
            "filters": [
                {
                    "type": "HeaderFilter",
                    "config": {
                        "messageType": "RESPONSE",
                        "add": [
                            {
                                "X-Powered-By": [
                                    "${projectName}"
                                ]
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            ],
            "handler": {
                "type": "StaticResponseHandler",
                "config": {
                    "status": 200,
                    "entity": "Hello World"
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "condition": "${matches(exchange.request.uri.path, '^/static')}"
}
   </programlisting>

   <itemizedlist>
    <para>
     Decorations are inherited as follows.
    </para>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Local decorations that are part of an object's declaration
      are inherited wherever the object is used.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      The "globalDecorations" on a route are inherited on child routes.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>

   <para>
    To prevent loops, decorators themselves cannot be decorated.
    Instead, decorators apply only to specific types of objects
    such as Filters and Handlers.
   </para>

   <para>
    ${projectName} defines some decorators,
    such as "audit", "baseURI", "capture", and "timer".
    You can use these without configuring them explicitly.
    For details see the reference section,
    <link
     xlink:show="new"
     xlink:href="reference#gateway-servlet"
     xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"
    ><citetitle>Gateway Servlet</citetitle></link>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Take care when defining decorator names not to use names
    that unintentionally clash with field names for the decorated objects.
    For all heap objects, avoid decorators named
    "config", "name", and "type".
    For Routes, avoid decorators named
    "baseURI", "condition", "globalDecorators",
    "heap", "handler", "name", and "session".
    In <filename>config.json</filename>,
    also avoid "logSink" and "temporaryStorage".
    In addition, avoid decorators named "comment" or "comments".
    The best way to avoid a clash with other field names
    is to avoid ${projectName} reserved field names,
    which include all purely alphanumeric field names.
    Instead use dots or dashes in your decorator names, such as "my-decorator".
   </para>

   <para>
    Decorations can apply more than once.
    For example, if you set a decoration
    both on a Route and also on an object defined within the route,
    then ${projectName} can apply the decoration twice.
    The following Route results in the request being captured twice.
   </para>

   <programlisting language="javascript">
{
  "handler": {
    "type": "ClientHandler",
    "capture": "request"
  },
  "capture": "all"
}
   </programlisting>

     ${projectName} applies decorations in this order.

      then those declared in the current route)
