 <title>Installing OpenIG</title>

 <itemizedlist>
  <para>Before you install OpenIG, make sure you have the right version of Java,
  and install and configure the web container.</para>
  <listitem>
   <para>Make sure you have the correct Java environment installed.</para>

   <screen>$ java -version
java version "1.6.0_24"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_24-b07-334-9M3326)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 19.1-b02-334, mixed mode)</screen>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>Refer to the chapter on <link xlink:href="gateway-guide#chap-container"
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Configuring
   Deployment Containers</citetitle></link> to ensure you have properly
   installed and configured your web application container and are running a
   supported version of Java.</para>
  </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>

 <para>For the remainder of this chapter <literal>$HOME</literal> refers to
 the home directory of the user running the web container where you install
 OpenIG.</para>

 <procedure xml:id="download-install-configure">
  <title>Download, Install, &amp; Configure</title>
  <step>
   <para><link xlink:href="http://www.forgerock.org/openig.html"
   xlink:show="new">Download</link> and if necessary unpack the gateway
   .war file.</para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>Deploy the .war to the root context of the web application
   container.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>Copy the <link xlink:href="gateway-guide#template-proxy-capture"
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink">proxy and capture</link>
   template. You can jump straight to a configuration template that best
   matches your application, but it is highly recommended you start with the
   basic proxy template.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>Copy the template to
   <filename>$HOME/.ForgeRock/OpenIG/config.json</filename>. Replace the
   <literal>TARGETIP</literal> tag in <filename>config.json</filename> with
   the IP address and port number of your target application.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>Modify DNS or host file settings so the name of your target
   application resolves to the IP address of OpenIG. Be sure to restart your
   browser after making this change.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>Start the web container where OpenIG is deployed and browse to the
   target application. OpenIG should now proxy all traffic to the
   application.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>To ensure the browser is going through OpenIG, stop the OpenIG web
   container, and verify you cannot reach the application. You can also look
   in the OpenIG capture log to verify the traffic is going through OpenIG.
   The location for this log is set in <filename>config.json</filename>, by
   default <filename>/tmp/gateway.log</filename>.
   </para>
