  If we develop enough of a monitoring framework,

 <para>
  ${projectName} provides a publish-and-subscribe audit framework.
  Filters and Handlers publish audit events.
  Agents in ${projectName} that are registered with the audit system can
  subscribe to audit events.
 </para>

 <para>
  Agents take responsibility for disseminating audit data
  to clients and to other systems.
  The
  <link
   xlink:show="new"
   xlink:href="reference#MonitorEndpointHandler"
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"
  >MonitorEndpointHandler</link> is an example of an audit agent.
 </para>

 <para>
  To audit a Filter, Handler, or a route, you add an audit decoration.
  Audit decoration values are tags, which are strings useful to audit agents.
  Agents can filter audit events of interest based on tags and other conditions.
  The following example route has an audit decoration.
 </para>

 <programlisting language="javascript">
<xinclude:include href="resources/config/routes/08-com.json" parse="text">
 <xinclude:fallback>
  Failed to include file
 </xinclude:fallback>
</xinclude:include>
 </programlisting>

 <para>
  ${projectName} creates an "audit" decorator, so you do not need to do so.
  For details on audit decorations, see the <citetitle>Reference</citetitle> for
  <link

 </para>

 <itemizedlist>
  <para>
   The "MonitorEndpointHandler" is a simple audit agent
   that collates basic statistics
   about the number of messages "in progress", "completed", and "internal errors"
   for each Filter or Handler that you have tagged,
   and returns the data in JSON format.
   To try auditing with the "MonitorEndpointHandler" agent,
   first set up the following routes.
  </para>

  <listitem>
   <para>
    A route for the "MonitorEndpointHandler",
    <filename>00-monitor.json</filename>:
   </para>

  <listitem>

    A route to ForgeRock.com, <filename>08-com.json</filename>:

    A default route with a static handler, <filename>99-default.json</filename>:

 <para>
  With the routes in place and ${projectName} running,
  access the following route endpoints a few times to trigger audit events
  by using the following URLs.
 </para>

 <simplelist>
  <member><link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="http://www.example.com:8080/" /></member>
  <member><link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="http://www.example.com:8080/?site=com" /></member>
  <member><link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="http://www.example.com:8080/?site=org" /></member>
 </simplelist>

 <para>
  After triggering a few audit events, access the monitor endpoint,
  <link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="http://www.example.com:8080/openig/monitor" />.
  You should see counts of the audit events in JSON format.
 </para>

 <programlisting language="javascript">
{
    "Static default route": {
        "in progress": 0,
        "completed": 14,
        "internal errors": 0
    },
    "ForgeRock.com route": {
        "in progress": 0,
        "completed": 16,
        "internal errors": 0
    },
    "ForgeRock.org route": {
        "in progress": 0,
        "completed": 15,
        "internal errors": 0
    },
    "global": {
        "in progress": 0,
        "completed": 45,
        "internal errors": 0
    }
}
 </programlisting>

 <para>
  According to the example output shown above,
  ${projectName} successfully handled 16 requests on the "ForgeRock.com route",
  15 requests on the "ForgeRock.org route", 14 default route requests
  for a total of 45 request completed on the top-level "global" route.

  You can build your own audit agents that implement
  <link
