 <title>Preface</title>

 <para>
  This guide provides instructions for installing and configuring ${projectName},
  a high-performance reverse proxy server with specialized session management
  and credential replay functionality.
 </para>

 <para>
  As a reverse proxy server (also referred to as a gateway in HTTP RFCs),
  ${projectName} filters all traffic to and from a server application,
  adapting requests to protect the service
  and adapting responses to filter outgoing content.
  The credential replay functionality effectively enables single sign-on
  with applications that do not integrate easily
  into a traditional single sign-on service.
