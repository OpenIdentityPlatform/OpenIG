 <title>Configuration Templates</title>

 <para>
  This chapter contains template routes for common configurations.
 </para>

 <para>
  Before you use one of the templates here,
  install and configure ${projectName} with a Router and default route
  as described in the chapter on
  <link
   xlink:show="new"
   xlink:href="gateway-guide#chap-quickstart"
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"
  ><citetitle>Getting Started</citetitle></link>.
 </para>

 <para>
  Next, take one of the templates and then modify it to suit your deployment.
  Read the summary of each template to find the right match for your application.
 </para>

 <para>
  When you move to use ${projectName} in production,
  be sure to turn off DEBUG level logging,
  and to remove "CaptureFilters" to avoid filling up disk space.
  Also consider locking down the Router configuration.
 </para>

 <section xml:id="template-proxy-capture">
  <title>Proxy &amp; Capture</title>

  <indexterm>
   <primary>Configuration</primary>
   <secondary>Proxy &amp; capture</secondary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   If you installed and configured ${projectName}
   with a Router and default route as described in the chapter on
   <link
    xlink:show="new"
    xlink:href="gateway-guide#chap-quickstart"
    xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"
   ><citetitle>Getting Started</citetitle></link>,
   then you already proxy &amp; capture
   both the application requests coming in and the server responses going out.
  </para>

  <para>
   This template is a replacement for the default route,
   <filename>${warRoutesDir}/99-default.json</filename>,
   with a "DispatchHandler" to change the scheme to HTTPS on login.
   Simply change the "baseURI" to that of the target application,
   and login to the application.
  </para>

 <section xml:id="template-simple-login">
  <title>Simple Login Form</title>

  <indexterm>
   <primary>Configuration</primary>
   <secondary>Simple login form</secondary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   Logs the user into the target application
   with hard-coded user name and password.
   This template intercepts the login page request
   and replaces it with the login form.
  </para>

  <para>
   This template is a replacement for the default route,
   <filename>${warRoutesDir}/99-default.json</filename>,
   Substitute <literal>TARGETIP</literal> with the IP address of your application.
   Also change <literal>MY_USERNAME</literal> and <literal>MY_PASSWORD</literal>,
   and adapt the "LoginRequest" for your application.
  </para>
 </section>

 <section xml:id="template-login-cookie">
  <title>Login Form With Cookie From Login Page</title>

  <indexterm>
   <primary>Configuration</primary>
   <secondary>Login with cookie</secondary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   For applications that expect a cookie from the login page
   to be sent in the login request form.
   This templates allows the login page request to go through to the target,
   intercepts the response,
   then creates the login form and adds the intercepted cookie to the POST.
  </para>

  <informalexample><?dbfo pgwide="1"?>
   <programlisting language="javascript">

  </informalexample>

  <para>
   This template is a replacement for the default route,
   <filename>${warRoutesDir}/99-default.json</filename>,
   Substitute <literal>TARGETIP</literal> with the IP address of your application.
   Also change <literal>MY_USERNAME</literal> and <literal>MY_PASSWORD</literal>,
   and adapt the "LoginRequest" for your application.
  </para>
 </section>

 <section xml:id="template-login-extract-cookie-filters">
  <title>Login Form With Extract Filter &amp; Cookie Filter</title>

  <indexterm>
   <primary>Configuration</primary>
   <secondary>Login with filter</secondary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   For applications that return the login page
   when the user tries to access a page without a valid session.
   This template shows how to use the <literal>ExtractFilter</literal>
   to find the login page on the response
   and use the <literal>CookieFilter</literal> to ensure
   the cookies from the application are replayed on each request.
   The sample application in this template is OpenAM.
  </para>

  <note>
   <para>
    Without the <literal>CookieFilter</literal> in the <literal>OutgoingChain</literal>
    the cookie set in the login page response would not get set in the browser
    since that request is intercepted before it gets to the browser.
    The simplest way to deal with this situation is
    to let ${projectName} manage all the cookies
    by enabling the <literal>CookieFilter</literal>.
    The side effect of ${projectName} managing cookies is
    none of the cookies are sent to the browser,
    but are managed locally by ${projectName}.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   This template is a replacement for the default route,
   <filename>${warRoutesDir}/99-default.json</filename>,
   Substitute <literal>TARGETIP</literal> with the IP address of OpenAM,
   <literal>TARGETFQDN</literal> with the fully qualified domain name of OpenAM,
   and <literal>PORT</literal> with the port on which OpenAM listens.
   Also change <literal>MY_USERNAME</literal> and <literal>MY_PASSWORD</literal>
   to match those of your OpenAM user.
  </para>

  <title>Login Which Requires a Hidden Value From the Login Page</title>

  <indexterm>

   and includes it in the login form POSTed to the target application.

  <title>HTTP &amp; HTTPS Application</title>

   <primary>Configuration</primary>
   <secondary>HTTP &amp; HTTPS</secondary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   Proxies traffic to an application listening on ports 80 and 443.
   The assumption is the application uses HTTPS for authentication
   and HTTP for the general application features.
   Assuming all login requests go to port 443,
   you must add the login filters and handlers
   to the <literal>LoginChain</literal>.
  </para>

   <filename>${warRoutesDir}/99-default.json</filename>,
   Substitute <literal>TARGETIP</literal> with the IP address of your application.
   Also add the necessary filter configurations
   that are required for login with your application,
   and then change <literal>MY_FILTERS</literal> to identify the added filters.
  </para>
 </section>

 <section xml:id="template-am-integration-headers">
  <title>OpenAM Integration With Headers</title>

  <para>
   Logs the user into the target application
   using the headers passed down from an OpenAM policy agent.
   This template assumes the user name and password
   are passed down by the OpenAM policy agent as headers.
   If the header passed in contains only a user name or subject
   and requires a lookup to an external data source,
   you must add an attribute filter to the chain to retrieve the credentials.
