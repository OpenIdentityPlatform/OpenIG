 <section>
  <title>Object not found in heap</title>

  <programlisting language="none">
HTTP ERROR 500
org.forgerock.openig.model.NodeException:
 ['file:/Users/george/.ForgeRock/OpenIG/config.json'].heap.objects[2]
  .config.filterObjects[0]: object not found in heap
at org.forgerock.openig.heaplet.HeapUtil.getRequiredObject(HeapUtil.java:54)
at org.forgerock.openig.filter.Chain$Heaplet.create(Chain.java:49)
  </programlisting>

  <para>You have a filter specified in the filterObjects list in the Chain
  object that is not in <filename>config.json</filename>.  Make sure you have
  added an entry for the Filter and have correctly spelled its name in the
  filterObjects list.</para>
 </section>

 <section>
  <title>Could not find local configuration file</title>

  <programlisting language="none">
HTTP ERROR 500
Problem accessing /. Reason:

 could not find local configuration file at
 /var/root/.ForgeRock/OpenIG/config.json or bootstrap file at
 /var/root/.ForgeRock/OpenIG/_private_var_folders_...webinf.json
  </programlisting>

  <para>OpenIG could not find its configuration file in the home directory of
  the user running the container where OpenIG is deployed, in this case
  <filename>/var/root/.ForgeRock/OpenIG/config.json</filename>.
  As you can see from the error message, OpenIG looks in a secondary location
  determined at runtime by the container. The secondary location is only
  necessary if you are running more than one OpenIG on a single host and your
  instances do not share a single configuration.</para>
 </section>

 <section>
  <title>Unexpected character (x) at position 1103</title>

  <programlisting language="none">
HTTP ERROR 500
Problem accessing /. Reason:

Unexpected character (x) at position 1103
  </programlisting>

  <para>This error usually means a missing double quote or a missing bracket
  in the configuration file.  Use a JSON editor or JSON validation tool
  such as <link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="http://jsonlint.com/"
  >JSONLint</link> to make sure your JSON is valid.</para>
 </section>

 <section>
  <title>The values in the flat file are incorrect</title>

  <para>Ensure the flat file is readable by the user running the container for
  OpenIG. Values are all characters, including space and tabs, between the
  separator, so make sure the values are not padded with spaces.</para>
 </section>

 <section>
  <title>Problem accessing URL</title>

  <programlisting language="none">
HTTP ERROR 500

Problem accessing /myURL . Reason:

java.lang.String cannot be cast to java.util.List
Caused by:
java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.String cannot be cast to java.util.List
at org.forgerock.openig.filter.LoggingFilter.writeHeaders(LoggingFilter.java:132
at org.forgerock.openig.filter.LoggingFilter.logResponse(LoggingFilter.java:119)
at org.forgerock.openig.filter.LoggingFilter.filter(LoggingFilter.java:86)
at org.forgerock.openig.filter.Chain.handle(Chain.java:54)
  </programlisting>

  <para>This error is typically encountered when using the <link
  xlink:href="reference#AssignmentFilter"
  xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink">AssignmentFilter</link> and
  setting a string value for one of the Headers. All headers are stored in
  Lists so the header must be addressed with a subscript. For example, if you
  try to set <literal>exchange.request.headers['Location']</literal> for a
  redirect in the response object, you should instead set
  <literal>exchange.request.headers['Location'][0]</literal>. A header without
  a subscript leads to the error above.</para>
 </section>

 <section>
  <title>StaticResponseHandler results in a blank page</title>

  <para>You must define an entity for the response. For example:</para>

  <programlisting language="javascript">{
    "name": "AccessDeniedHandler",
    "type": "org.forgerock.openig.handler.StaticResponseHandler",
    "config": {
        "status": 403,
        "reason": "Forbidden",
        "entity": "&lt;html>&lt;h2>User does not have permission&lt;/h2>&lt;/html>"
    }
}</programlisting>
 </section>

 <section>
  <title>OpenIG is not logging users in</title>

  <para>If you are proxying to more than one application in multiple DNS
  domains, you must make sure your container is enabled for domain cookies.
  See the chapter on <link xlink:href="gateway-guide#chap-container"
  xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Configuring
  Deployment Containers</citetitle></link> for details on your specific
  container.</para>
