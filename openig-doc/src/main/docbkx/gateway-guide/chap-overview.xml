 <title>Solutions Overview</title>

 <para>
  ForgeRock ${projectName} provides the answer to three important challenges.
 </para>

 <section xml:id="sso-for-any-app">
  <title>Extend SSO To Any Application</title>

  <para>In today's enterprise, more than 30% of web applications are
  incompatible with web access management (WAM) software. That is, unlike
  OpenAM with ${projectName}, most web access management products lack the agent
  to protect the web applications, or the application is a legacy solution that
  does not follow standard protocols for single sign-on. This limits the return
  on the enterprise WAM investment and constrains what types of web applications
  can be protected.</para>

  <para>ForgeRock ${projectName} addresses this problem by extending
  access management to encompass <emphasis>all</emphasis> web applications.
  With ${projectName}, OpenAM deployments can now be extended to be inclusive of those
  applications that do not integrate with policy agents alone. In addition,
  ForgeRock ${projectName} interoperates, out-of-the-box, with all
  management solutions. Most importantly, your organization can on-board any
  web application without ever modifying or touching the target application
  again, significantly reducing the development and quality assurance required
  to protect web applications.</para>
 </section>

 <section xml:id="federate-any-app">
  <title>Federate Enabling Applications</title>

  <para>
   The expertise and cost required to add SAML 2.0 support to web applications
   is a problem for many businesses.
   Those businesses not moving to a standard
   for exposing their applications to their customers
   see increased cost and maintenance due to the complexity
   of one-off proprietary integrations.
   They can also see a loss of business to those customers
   requiring a Federation standard for authentication.
   Sometimes, deploying a full access management solution
   just to federate a few applications is is too complex and costly,
   and building out their own solution by modifying their applications
   is just not possible.
  </para>

   <textobject>
    <para>${projectName} lets you quickly federate any application.</para>
   </textobject>
  </mediaobject>

  <para>
   ${projectName} Federation allows businesses to add SAML 2.0 support
   to their applications with little to no knowledge of the standard.
   In addition, there is no need to modify the application
   or to install any plugin or policy agent on the application container.
  </para>
 </section>

 <section xml:id="standards-based-policy-enforcement">
  <title>Implement Standards Based Policy Enforcement</title>

  <para>
   In order to provide SSO, OpenAM policy enforcement points,
   called policy agents,
   have traditionally functioned as plugins for each application.
   The policy agents however use OpenAM-specific APIs and protocols.
   In contrast, you can roll out ${projectName}
   as an independent policy enforcement point
   that is built on the SAML 2.0 standard.
  </para>

  <mediaobject xml:id="figure-standards-based-agent">
   <imageobject>
    <imagedata fileref="images/standards-based-agent.png" format="PNG" />
   </imageobject>
   <textobject>
    <para>
     ${projectName} integrates well as a policy enforcement point
     with OpenAM and with other standards-based solutions.
    </para>
   </textobject>
  </mediaobject>

  <para>
   ${projectName} Federation can replace policy agents
   with a standards-based SAML 2.0-compliant enforcement point.
  </para>
