 <title>Solutions Overview</title>

 <para>ForgeRock's Open Identity Gateway (OpenIG) provides the answer to
 three important challenges.</para>

 <section xml:id="sso-for-any-app">
  <title>Extend SSO To Any Application</title>

  <para>In today's enterprise, more than 30% of web applications are
  incompatible with vendor web access management solutions. That is, web
  access management (WAM) products do not provide agents for protecting the
  web application, or the application is a legacy solution that does not
  follow standard protocols for single sign-on. This limits the return on the
  enterprise WAM investment and constrains what types of web applications can
  be protected.</para>

  <para>ForgeRock Open Identity Gateway addresses this problem by extending
  vendor WAM solutions to include <emphasis>all</emphasis> web applications.
  Access management deployments can now be extended to be inclusive of those
  applications that do not integrate with your WAM solution. ForgeRock Open
  Identity Gateway integrates, out-of-the-box, with all management solutions.
  Most importantly, enterprises can on-board any web application without ever
  modifying or touching the target application again, significantly reducing
  the development and quality assurance required to protect web
  applications.</para>
 </section>

 <section xml:id="federate-any-app">
  <title>Federate Enabling Applications</title>

  <para>The expertise and cost required to add SAML2 support to web
  applications is a problem for many businesses. Those businesses not moving
  to a standard for exposing their applications to their customers see
  increased cost and maintenance due to the complexity of one-off proprietary
  integrations. They may also see a loss of business to those customers
  requiring a Federation standard for authentication. Purchasing a full-blown
  Access Management product just to Federate a few applications is far too
  complex and costly, and building out their own solution by modifying their
  applications is just not possible.</para>

  <para>OpenIG Federation Gateway allows businesses to add SAML2 support to
  their applications with little to no knowledge of the standard. In addition,
  there is no need to modify the application or install any plugin or agent on
  the application container.</para>
 </section>

 <section xml:id="standards-based-policy-enforcement">
  <title>Implement Standards Based Policy Enforcement</title>

  <para>In order to provide SSO, Access Management solutions require their own
  proprietary policy enforcement points (plugins) for each application. These
  proprietary enforcement points lock customers into a single Access Management
  solution, proprietary APIs and protocols. What customers need is an Access
  Management independent policy enforcement point that is built on the SAML2
  standard.</para>

  <para>OpenIG Federation Gateway can replace proprietary policy enforcement
  points with a standards based SAML2 compliant enforcement point.</para>
