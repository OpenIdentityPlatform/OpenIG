  <h1>Trying User-Managed Access (UMA)</h1>

  <p>
    This demonstrates a simple UMA scenario involving OpenAM, OpenIG,
    and users Alice (resource owner) and Bob (requesting party).
  </p>

  <p>
    There are two client pages:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <a href="alice.html" target="_blank">Alice shares resources</a>
    </li>

    <li>
      <a href="bob.html" target="_blank">Bob accesses resources</a>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <div id="conf"></div>

  <script type="text/javascript">
$(document).ready(function () {
  $("#conf").html(json2html(conf, "Current Configuration"));
});
  </script>
</body>
</html>
