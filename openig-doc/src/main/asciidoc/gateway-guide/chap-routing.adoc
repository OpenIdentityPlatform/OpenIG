[#chap-routing]
== Configuring Routes

Other tutorials in this guide demonstrate how to use routes so that you can change the configuration without restarting OpenIG. This chapter takes a closer look at `Router` and `Route` configurations, further described in xref:../reference/handlers-conf.adoc#Router[Router(5)] in the __Configuration Reference__ and xref:../reference/handlers-conf.adoc#Route[Route(5)] in the __Configuration Reference__. In this chapter, you will learn to:

* Protect multiple routes with the same OpenIG server

* Lock down OpenIG configurations for deployment


[#routing-router-setup]
=== Configuring Routers

When you set up the first tutorial, you configured a `Router`.

The `Router` is a handler that you can configure in the top-level `config.json` file for OpenIG, and in fact wherever you can configure a `Handler`. For the first tutorial, you added a `Router` as part of the base configuration, which is shown here again in the following listing:

[source, javascript]
----
{
  "handler": {
    "type": "Router",
    "audit": "global",
    "baseURI": "http://app.example.com:8081",
    "capture": "all"
  },
  "heap": [
    {
      "name": "LogSink",
      "type": "ConsoleLogSink",
      "config": {
        "level": "DEBUG"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "JwtSession",
      "type": "JwtSession"
    },
    {
      "name": "capture",
      "type": "CaptureDecorator",
      "config": {
        "captureEntity": true,
        "_captureContext": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
----
The `Router`'s job is to pass the request and context to a route that matches a condition, and to periodically reload changed route configurations. As routes define the conditions on which they accept any given request, the `Router` does not have to know about specific `Routes` in advance. In other words, you can configure the `Router` first and then add routes while OpenIG is running, as you have done in the tutorials.

The configuration shown above passes all requests to the `Router` using the default settings, meaning that the `Router` monitors `$HOME/.openig/config/routes` for `Routes`. When OpenIG receives a request, if more time has passed than the default scan interval of 10 seconds, then OpenIG rescans the routes directory for changes and reloads any routes changes it finds.


[#routing-route-setup]
=== Configuring Additional Routes

Routes are configurations to handle a request that meets a specified condition.

The condition is defined using an OpenIG expression as described in xref:../reference/expressions-conf.adoc#Expressions[Expressions(5)] in the __Configuration Reference__. It can be based on almost any characteristic of the request, context, or even of the OpenIG runtime environment. Another way to think of the `Route` is like an independent `DispatchHandler` as described in xref:../reference/handlers-conf.adoc#DispatchHandler[DispatchHandler(5)] in the __Configuration Reference__.

The following example shows a condition setting. With this condition on a route, the route matches all requests that have `api.example.com` as the host portion of the URI:

[source, javascript]
----
"condition": "${request.uri.host == 'api.example.com'}"
----
Routes can also have their own names, used to order them lexicographically. If no name is specified, the route file name is used. Route file names have the extension `.json`. In other words, a router only scans for files with the `.json` extension, and ignores files with other extensions.

Routes can have a base URI to change the scheme, host, and port of the request.

Routes wrap a heap of configuration objects, and hand off any request they accept to a handler. In this way each route is much like its own server-wide configuration file.

If no condition is specified for the route, the route accepts any request. The following is a basic default route that accepts any request and forwards it on without changes:

[source, javascript]
----
{
    "name": "default",
    "handler": {
        "type": "ClientHandler"
    }
}
----


[#routing-lockdown]
=== Locking Down Route Configurations

Having the `Route` configurations automatically reloaded is great in the lab, but is perhaps not what you want in production.

In that case, stop the server, edit the `Router` `scanInterval`, and restart. When `scanInterval` is set to -1, the `Router` only loads routes at startup:

[source, javascript]
----
{
    "name": "Router",
    "type": "Router",
    "config": {
        "scanInterval": -1
    }
}
----
You can also change the file system location to look for routes:

[source, javascript]
----
{
    "name": "Router",
    "type": "Router",
    "config": {
        "directory": "/path/to/safe/routes",
        "scanInterval": -1
    }
}
----
