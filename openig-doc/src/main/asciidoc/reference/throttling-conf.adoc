[#throttling-conf]
== Throttling Filters and Policies

To protect applications from being overused by clients, use a throttling filter to limit how many requests clients can make in a defined time.
[#ThrottlingFilter]
=== ThrottlingFilter — limit the rate of requests

[#d210e12838]
==== Description
Limits the rate that requests pass through a filter. The maximum number of requests that a client is allowed to make in a defined time is called the __throttling rate__.

The throttling filter uses a strategy based on the token bucket algorithm, which allows some bursts. Because of traffic bursts, the throttling rate can occasionally be higher than the defined limit - for example, with a throttling rate of 10 requests/10 seconds there can be more than 10 requests in the 10 second duration. However, the number of concurrent requests cannot exceed that defined for the throttling rate - for example, with a throttling rate of 10 requests/10 seconds there cannot be more than 10 concurrent requests.

When the throttling rate is reached, OpenIG issues an HTTP status code 429 `Too Many Requests` and a `Retry-After` header, whose value is rounded up to the number of seconds to wait before trying the request again.

[#d210e12873]
==== Properties
--

`"requestGroupingPolicy"`: __expression, required__::
An expression to identify the partition to use for the request. In many cases the partition identifies an individual client that sends requests, but it can also identify a group that sends requests. The expression can evaluate to the client IP address or user ID, or an OpenID Connect subject/issuer.

+
Default: Empty string. The value for this expression must not be null.

+
See also xref:expressions-conf.adoc#Expressions[Expressions(5)].

`"throttlingRatePolicy"`: __reference or inline declaration, required if "rate" is not used__::
A reference to or inline declaration of a policy to apply for throttling rate. The following policies can be used:

* xref:#MappedThrottlingPolicy[MappedThrottlingPolicy(5)]

* xref:#ScriptableThrottlingPolicy[ScriptableThrottlingPolicy(5)]

* xref:#DefaultRateThrottlingPolicy[DefaultRateThrottlingPolicy(5)]

+
This value for this parameter must not be null.

`"rate"`: __rate object, required if "throttlingRatePolicy" is not used__::
The throttling rate to apply to requests. The rate is calculated as the number of requests divided by the duration.

`"numberOfRequests"`: __integer, required__::
The number of requests allowed through the filter in the time specified by `"duration"`.

`"duration"`: __duration string, required__::
A time interval during which the number of requests passing through the filter is counted.
+
A link:../apidocs/index.html?org/forgerock/openig/util/Duration.html[duration, window=\_blank] is a lapse of time expressed in English, such as `23 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds`.

Durations are not case sensitive.

Negative durations are not supported.

The following units can be used in durations:

* `indefinite`, `infinity`, `undefined`, `unlimited`: unlimited duration

* `zero`, `disabled`: zero-length duration

* `days`, `day`, `d`: days

* `hours`, `hour`, `h`: hours

* `minutes`, `minute`, `min`, `m`: minutes

* `seconds`, `second`, `sec`, `s`: seconds

* `milliseconds`, `millisecond`, `millisec`, `millis`, `milli`, `ms`: milliseconds

* `microseconds`, `microsecond`, `microsec`, `micros`, `micro`, `us`: microseconds

* `nanoseconds`, `nanosecond`, `nanosec`, `nanos`, `nano`, `ns`: nanoseconds


`"cleaningInterval"`: __duration, optional__::
The time to wait before cleaning outdated partitions. The value must be more than zero but not more than one day.

`"executor"`: __executor, optional__::
An executor service to schedule the execution of tasks, such as the clean up of partitions that are no longer used.

+
Default: `ScheduledExecutorService`

+
See also xref:misc-conf.adoc#ScheduledExecutorService[ScheduledExecutorService(5)].

[#example-throttling-mapped]
==== Example of a Mapped Throttling Policy
In the following example, requests from users in the accounts and sales departments of `example.com` are mapped to different throttling rates. Requests from other departments use the default throttling rate. For information about how to set up and test this example, see xref:../gateway-guide/chap-throttling.adoc#throttling-mapped[ Configuring a Mapped Throttling Filter ] in the __Gateway Guide__.

Alice and Bob both send requests from accounts, and so they each have a throttling rate of 6 requests/10 seconds. The throttling rate is applied independently to Alice and Bob, so no matter how many requests Alice sends in 10 seconds, Bob can still send up to 6 requests in the same 10 seconds. Carol sends requests from sales, with a throttling rate of 3 requests/10 seconds. Dave sends requests from finance, with the default rate of 1 request/10 seconds.

The throttling rate is assigned according to the evaluation of `throttlingRateMapper`. In the example, this parameter evaluates to the value of the request header `X-Forwarded-For`, representing the hostname of the department.

`"type"`: __string, required__::
The Internet media type (formerly MIME type) of the script. For Groovy, the value is `"application/x-groovy"`.

`"file"`: __string, required if "source" is not used__::
The path to the file containing the script.

+
Relative paths in this field are relative to the base location for scripts, which depends on the configuration. For information, see xref:../gateway-guide/chap-install.adoc#install[Installing OpenIG] in the __Gateway Guide__.

+
The base location for Groovy scripts is on the classpath when the scripts are executed. If a Groovy script is not in the default package, but instead has its own package name, it belongs in the directory corresponding to the package name. For example, a script in package `com.example.groovy` belongs under `openig-base/scripts/groovy/com/example/groovy/`.

`"source"`: __string, required if "file" is not used__::
The script as a string.

[#example-throttling-scriptable]
==== Example of a Scriptable Throttling Policy
In the following example, the `DefaultRateThrottlingPolicy` delegates the management of throttling to the scriptable throttling policy. For information about how to set up and test this example, see xref:../gateway-guide/chap-throttling.adoc#throttling-scriptable[ Configuring a Scriptable Throttling Filter ] in the __Gateway Guide__.

The script applies a throttling rate of 6 requests/10 seconds to requests from the accounts department of `example.com`. For all other requests, the script returns `null`. When the script returns `null`, the default rate of 1 request/10 seconds is applied.

The script can store the mapping for the throttling rate in memory, and can use a more complex mapping mechanism than that used in the `MappedThrottlingPolicy`. For example, the script can map the throttling rate for a range of IP addresses. The script can also query an LDAP directory, query an external database, or read the mapping from a file.
