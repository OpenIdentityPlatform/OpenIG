[#throttling-conf]
== Throttling Filters and Policies

To protect applications from being overused by clients, use a throttling filter to limit how many requests clients can make in a defined time.
[#ThrottlingFilter]
=== ThrottlingFilter — limit the rate of requests

[#d210e12838]
==== Description
Limits the rate that requests pass through a filter. The maximum number of requests that a client is allowed to make in a defined time is called the _throttling rate_ .
The throttling filter uses a strategy based on the token bucket algorithm, which allows some bursts. Because of traffic bursts, the throttling rate can occasionally be higher than the defined limit - for example, with a throttling rate of 10 requests/10 seconds there can be more than 10 requests in the 10 second duration. However, the number of concurrent requests cannot exceed that defined for the throttling rate - for example, with a throttling rate of 10 requests/10 seconds there cannot be more than 10 concurrent requests.
When the throttling rate is reached, OpenIG issues an HTTP status code 429 `Too Many Requests` and a `Retry-After` header, whose value is rounded up to the number of seconds to wait before trying the request again.

----

[#d210e12873]
==== Properties
--

"requestGroupingPolicy": expression, required::
An expression to identify the partition to use for the request. In many cases the partition identifies an individual client that sends requests, but it can also identify a group that sends requests. The expression can evaluate to the client IP address or user ID, or an OpenID Connect subject/issuer.
+
Default: Empty string. The value for this expression must not be null.
+
See also xref:expressions-conf.adoc#Expressions[Expressions(5)] .

"throttlingRatePolicy": reference or inline declaration, required if "rate" is not used::
A reference to or inline declaration of a policy to apply for throttling rate. The following policies can be used:

*  xref:#MappedThrottlingPolicy[MappedThrottlingPolicy(5)] 

*  xref:#ScriptableThrottlingPolicy[ScriptableThrottlingPolicy(5)] 

*  xref:#DefaultRateThrottlingPolicy[DefaultRateThrottlingPolicy(5)] 

+
This value for this parameter must not be null.

"rate": rate object, required if "throttlingRatePolicy" is not used::
The throttling rate to apply to requests. The rate is calculated as the number of requests divided by the duration.

"numberOfRequests": integer, required::
The number of requests allowed through the filter in the time specified by `"duration"` .

"duration": duration string, required::
A time interval during which the number of requests passing through the filter is counted.
+
A link:../apidocs/index.html?org/forgerock/openig/util/Duration.html[duration, window=\_blank] is a lapse of time expressed in English, such as `23 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds` .
Durations are not case sensitive.
Negative durations are not supported.
The following units can be used in durations:

*  `indefinite` , `infinity` , `undefined` , `unlimited` : unlimited duration

*  `zero` , `disabled` : zero-length duration

*  `days` , `day` , `d` : days

*  `hours` , `hour` , `h` : hours

*  `nanoseconds` , `nanosecond` , `nanosec` , `nanos` , `nano` , `ns` : nanoseconds


"cleaningInterval": duration, optional::
The time to wait before cleaning outdated partitions. The value must be more than zero but not more than one day.

"executor": executor, optional::
An executor service to schedule the execution of tasks, such as the clean up of partitions that are no longer used.
+
Default: `ScheduledExecutorService` 
+

[#example-throttling-mapped]
==== Example of a Mapped Throttling Policy
In the following example, requests from users in the accounts and sales departments of `example.com` are mapped to different throttling rates. Requests from other departments use the default throttling rate. For information about how to set up and test this example, see xref:../gateway-guide/chap-throttling.adoc#throttling-mapped[Section 16.2, " Configuring a Mapped Throttling Filter "] in the _Gateway Guide_ .
Alice and Bob both send requests from accounts, and so they each have a throttling rate of 6 requests/10 seconds. The throttling rate is applied independently to Alice and Bob, so no matter how many requests Alice sends in 10 seconds, Bob can still send up to 6 requests in the same 10 seconds. Carol sends requests from sales, with a throttling rate of 3 requests/10 seconds. Dave sends requests from finance, with the default rate of 1 request/10 seconds.
The throttling rate is assigned according to the evaluation of `throttlingRateMapper` . In the example, this parameter evaluates to the value of the request header `X-Forwarded-For` , representing the hostname of the department.

"type": string, required::
The Internet media type (formerly MIME type) of the script. For Groovy, the value is `"application/x-groovy"` .

"file": string, required if "source" is not used::
The path to the file containing the script.

The base location for Groovy scripts is on the classpath when the scripts are executed. If a Groovy script is not in the default package, but instead has its own package name, it belongs in the directory corresponding to the package name. For example, a script in package `com.example.groovy` belongs under `openig-base/scripts/groovy/com/example/groovy/` .

"source": string, required if "file" is not used::
The script as a string.

[#example-throttling-scriptable]
==== Example of a Scriptable Throttling Policy
In the following example, the `DefaultRateThrottlingPolicy` delegates the management of throttling to the scriptable throttling policy. For information about how to set up and test this example, see xref:../gateway-guide/chap-throttling.adoc#throttling-scriptable[Section 16.3, " Configuring a Scriptable Throttling Filter "] in the _Gateway Guide_ .
The script applies a throttling rate of 6 requests/10 seconds to requests from the accounts department of `example.com` . For all other requests, the script returns `null` . When the script returns `null` , the default rate of 1 request/10 seconds is applied.
The script can store the mapping for the throttling rate in memory, and can use a more complex mapping mechanism than that used in the `MappedThrottlingPolicy` . For example, the script can map the throttling rate for a range of IP addresses. The script can also query an LDAP directory, query an external database, or read the mapping from a file.
