[#CookieFilter]
=== CookieFilter — manage, suppress, relay cookies

[#d210e4808]
==== Description
Manages, suppresses and relays cookies. Managed cookies are intercepted by the cookie filter itself and stored in the gateway session; managed cookies are not transmitted to the user agent. Suppressed cookies are removed from both request and response. Relayed cookies are transmitted freely between user agent and remote server and vice-versa.

If a cookie does not appear in one of the three action parameters, then the default action is performed, controlled by setting the `defaultAction` parameter. If unspecified, the default action is to manage all cookies. In the event a cookie appears in more than one configuration parameter, then it will be selected in the order of precedence: managed, suppressed, relayed.

[#d210e5163]
==== Examples
Extracts a nonce from the response, which is typically a login page, and sets its value in the attributes context to be used by the downstream filter posting the login form. The nonce value would be accessed using the following expression: `${attributes.extract.wpLoginToken}`.

The pattern finds all matches in the HTTP body of the form `wpLogintoken value="abc"`. Setting the template to `$1` assigns the value `abc` to `attributes.extract.wpLoginToken`:

[#FileAttributesFilter]
=== FileAttributesFilter — retrieve record from a file

[#d210e5216]
==== Description
Retrieves and exposes a record from a delimiter-separated file. Lookup of the record is performed using a specified `key`, whose `value` is derived from an expression. The resulting record is exposed in an object whose location is specified by the `target` expression. If a matching record cannot be found, then the resulting object is empty.

The retrieval of the record is performed lazily; it does not occur until the first attempt to access a value in the `target`. This defers the overhead of file operations and text processing until a value is first required. This also means that the value expression is not evaluated until the object is first accessed.

[#d210e5240]
==== Usage

[source, javascript]
----
{
     "name": string,
     "type": "FileAttributesFilter",
     "config": {

`TAB`::
Tab separated values, with support for quoted literal strings.

====
+
Default: `COMMA`

`"header"`: __boolean, optional__::
The setting to treat or not treat the first row of the file as a header row.

+
When the first row of the file is treated as a header row, the data in that row is disregarded and cannot be returned by a lookup operation.

+
Default: `true`.

`"fields"`: __array of strings, optional__::
A list of keys in the order they appear in a record.

+
If `fields` is not set, the keys are assigned automatically by the column numbers of the file.

`"target"`: __lvalue-expression, required__::
Expression that yields the target object to contain the record.

+
The target object is a `Map<String, String>`, where the fields are the keys. For example, if the target is `${attributes.file}` and the record has a `username` field and a `password` field mentioned in the fields list, Then you can access the user name as `${attributes.file.username}` and the password as `${attributes.file.password}`.

+
See also xref:expressions-conf.adoc#Expressions[Expressions(5)].

`"key"`: __string, required__::
The key used for the lookup operation.

An OAuth2ClientFilter is a filter that authenticates an end user using OAuth 2.0 delegated authorization. The filter can act as an OpenID Connect relying party as well as an OAuth 2.0 client.

The client filter does not include information about identity providers, or information about static registration with identity providers. For information about an identity provider, see xref:misc-conf.adoc#Issuer[Issuer(5)]. For information about registration with an identity provider, see xref:misc-conf.adoc#ClientRegistration[ClientRegistration(5)].

In the case where all users share the same identity provider, you can configure the filter as a client of a single provider by referencing a single client registration name for the filter. You can also configure the filter to work with multiple providers, taking the user to a login handler page—often full of provider logos, and known as a __Nascar page__. The name comes from Nascar race cars, some of which are covered with sponsors' logos—to choose a provider.
--
What an OAuth2ClientFilter does depends on the incoming request URI. In the following list __clientEndpoint__ represents the value of the clientEndpoint in the filter configuration:

`clientEndpoint/login/?discovery=user-input&goto=url`::
Using the __user-input__ value, discover and register dynamically with the end user's OpenID Provider or with the client registration endpoint as described in RFC 7591.

+
Upon successful registration, redirect the end user to the provider for authentication and authorization consent before redirecting the user-agent back to the callback client endpoint.

`clientEndpoint/login?registration=registrationName&goto=url`::
Redirect the end user for authorization with the specified __registration__, which is the name of a ClientRegistration configuration as described in xref:misc-conf.adoc#ClientRegistration[ClientRegistration(5)].

+
The provider corresponding to the registration then authenticates the end user and obtains authorization consent before redirecting the user-agent back to the callback client endpoint.

+
Ultimately if the entire process is successful, the filter saves the authorization state in the context and redirects the user-agent to the specified URL.

`clientEndpoint/logout?goto=url`::
Remove the authorization state for the end user and redirect to the specified URL.

`clientEndpoint/callback`::
Handle the callback from the OAuth 2.0 authorization server that occurs as part of the authorization process.

+
If the callback is handled successfully, the filter saves the authorization state in the context at the specified target location and redirects to the URL during login.

Other request URIs::
Restore authorization state in the specified target location and call the next filter or handler in the chain.

`"clientEndpoint"`: __expression, required__::
Base URI for the filter.

+
For example, if you set `"clientEndpoint": "/openid"`, then the service URIs for this filter on your OpenIG server are `/openid/login`, `/openid/logout`, and `/openid/callback`.

+
See also xref:expressions-conf.adoc#Expressions[Expressions(5)].

`"failureHandler"`: __Handler reference, required__::
Provide an inline handler configuration object, or the name of a handler object that is defined in the heap.

+
If this handler is invoked, then the target in the context can be populated with information such as the exception, client registration, and error.

+
The failure object in the target is a simple map, similar to the following example:
+

{
    "client_registration": "ClientRegistration name string",
    "error": {
        "realm": "optional string",
        "scope": [ "optional required scope string", ... ],
        "error": "optional string",
        "error_description": "optional string",
        "error_uri": "optional string"
    },

+
Default: OpenIG uses the default ClientHandler.

+
See also xref:handlers-conf.adoc#handlers-conf[Handlers], xref:handlers-conf.adoc#ClientHandler[ClientHandler(5)].

`"loginHandler"`: __Handler reference, required if there are zero or multiple client registrations, optional if there is one client registration__::
Use this Handler when the user must choose an identity provider. When `registrations` contains only one client registration, this Handler is optional but is displayed if specified.

+
Provide either the name of a Handler object defined in the heap, or an inline Handler configuration object.

+
For an example of a login handler where no client registrations are defined, see xref:../gateway-guide/chap-oauth2-client.adoc#oidc-discovery-setup-gateway[Preparing OpenIG for Discovery and Dynamic Registration] in the __Gateway Guide__. The following example shows a login handler that allows the user to choose from two client registrations: `openam` and `google`:

==== Example
The following example configures an OAuth 2.0 client filter. The base client endpoint is `/openid`. The filter uses well-known configuration endpoints to obtain configuration information for OpenAM and for Google as providers. The client credentials are not shown.

When a incoming request is made to `/openid/login`, this filter takes the user to a NascarPage to choose an identity provider. It then handles negotiation for authorization with the provider.

If the authorization process completes successfully, then the filter injects the authorization state data into `attributes.openid`.

At the end of the interaction, the aim of this configuration is simply to dump the data obtained back in the response:

[source, javascript]

[#OAuth2ResourceServerFilter]
=== OAuth2ResourceServerFilter — validate a request containing an OAuth 2.0 access token

[#OAuth2ResourceServerFilter-description]
==== Description
An OAuth2ResourceServerFilter is a filter that validates a request containing an OAuth 2.0 access token. The filter expects an OAuth 2.0 token from the HTTP Authorization header of the request, such as the following example header, where the OAuth 2.0 access token is `1fc0e143-f248-4e50-9c13-1d710360cec9`:

[source, httprequest]
----
Authorization: Bearer 1fc0e143-f248-4e50-9c13-1d710360cec9
----
The filter extracts the access token, and then validates it against the configured tokenInfoEndpoint URL.

On successful validation, the filter creates a new context for the authorization server response, at `${contexts.oauth2}`.

The context is named `oauth2` and can be reached at `contexts.oauth2` or `contexts['oauth2']`.

The context contains data such as the access token, which can be reached at `contexts.oauth2.accessToken` or `contexts['oauth2'].accessToken`.

Regarding errors, if the filter configuration and access token together result in an invalid request to the authorization server, the filter returns an HTTP 400 Bad Request response to the user-agent.

If the access token is missing from the request, the filter returns an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response to the user-agent:

[source, httprequest]
----
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="OpenIG"
----
If the access token is not valid, for example, because it has expired, the filter also returns an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response to the user-agent.

If the scopes for the access token do not match the specified required scopes, the filter returns an HTTP 403 Forbidden response to the user-agent.

[#PolicyEnforcementFilter]
=== PolicyEnforcementFilter — enforce policy decisions from OpenAM

[#d210e7133]
==== Description
This filter requests policy decisions from OpenAM, which allows or denies the request based on the request context, the request URI, and the OpenAM policies.

* If the request is allowed, processing continues.

* If the request is denied, OpenIG returns 403 Forbidden.

* If an error occurs during the process, OpenIG returns 500 Internal Server Error.

This filter allows you to specify the subject by SSO token, JWT, or JWT claims.

This filter can add contextual attributes (accessible through `${attributes}`), and some elements returned by the policy decision, such as attributes and advices.

[NOTE]
====
In the OpenAM policy, remember to configure the `Resources` parameter with the URI of the protected application.

The request URI from OpenIG must match the `Resources` parameter defined in the OpenAM policy. If the URI of the incoming request is changed before it enters the policy filter (for example, by rebasing or scripting), remember to change the `Resources` parameter in OpenAM policy accordingly.

[#ScriptableFilter]
=== ScriptableFilter — process requests and responses by using a script

[#d210e7674]
==== Description
Processes requests and responses by using a script.

The script must return either a link:{apidocs-url}/index.html?org/forgerock/util/promise/Promise.html[Promise<Response, NeverThrowsException>, window=\_blank] or a link:{apidocs-url}/index.html?org/forgerock/http/protocol/Response.html[Response, window=\_blank].

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you are writing scripts or Java extensions, never use a `Promise` blocking method, such as `get()`, `getOrThrow()`, or `getOrThrowUninterruptibly()`, to obtain the response.

A promise represents the result of an asynchronous operation. Therefore, using a blocking method to wait for the result can cause deadlocks and/or race issues.
====
[#d210e7710]
===== Classes
The following classes are imported automatically for Groovy scripts:

* `org.forgerock.http.Client`

* `org.forgerock.http.Filter`

* `org.forgerock.http.Handler`

* `org.forgerock.http.filter.throttling.ThrottlingRate`

* `org.forgerock.http.util.Uris`

* `org.forgerock.util.AsyncFunction`

* `org.forgerock.util.Function`

* `org.forgerock.util.promise.NeverThrowsException`

* `org.forgerock.util.promise.Promise`

* `org.forgerock.services.context.Context`

* `org.forgerock.http.protocol.*`


[#d210e7783]
===== Objects
--
The script has access to the following global objects:

Any parameters passed as args::
You can use the configuration to pass parameters to the script by specifying an args object.

+
Take care when naming keys in the args object. If you reuse the name of another global object, cause the script to fail and OpenIG to return a response with HTTP status code 500 Internal Server Error.

`attributes`::
The link:{apidocs-url}/index.html?org/forgerock/services/context/AttributesContext.html[attributes, window=\_blank] object provides access to a context map of arbitrary attributes, which is a mechanism for transferring transient state between components when processing a single request.

+
Use `session` for maintaining state between successive requests from the same logical client.

`context`::
The processing link:{apidocs-url}/index.html?org/forgerock/services/context/Context.html[context, window=\_blank].

+
This context is the leaf of a chain of contexts. It provides access to other Context types, such as SessionContext, AttributesContext, and ClientContext, through the `context.asContext(ContextClass.class)` method.

`request`::
The HTTP link:{apidocs-url}/index.html?org/forgerock/http/protocol/Request.html[request, window=\_blank].

`globals`::
This object is a link:http://groovy.codehaus.org/groovy-jdk/index.html?java/util/Map.html[Map, window=\_blank] that holds variables that persist across successive invocations.

`http`::
An embedded client for making outbound HTTP requests, which is an link:{apidocs-url}/index.html?org/forgerock/http/Client.html[org.forgerock.http.Client, window=\_blank].

+
If a `"clientHandler"` is set in the configuration, then that Handler is used. Otherwise, the default ClientHandler configuration is used.

+
For details, see xref:handlers-conf.adoc#handlers-conf[Handlers].

`ldap`::
The link:{apidocs-url}/index.html?org/forgerock/openig/ldap/LdapClient.html[ldap, window=\_blank] object provides an embedded LDAP client.

+
Use this client to perform outbound LDAP requests, such as LDAP authentication.

`logger`::
The link:{apidocs-url}/index.html?org/forgerock/openig/log/Logger.html[logger, window=\_blank] object provides access to the server log sink.

`next`::
The link:{apidocs-url}/index.html?org/forgerock/http/Handler.html[next, window=\_blank] object refers to the next handler in the filter chain.

`session`::
The link:{apidocs-url}/index.html?org/forgerock/http/session/SessionContext.html[session, window=\_blank] object provides access to the session context, which is a mechanism for maintaining state when processing a successive requests from the same logical client or end-user.

+
Use `attributes` for transferring transient state between components when processing a single request.

--
When you have finished processing the request, execute `return next.handle(context, request)` to call the next filter or handler in the current chain and return the value from the call. Actions on the response must be performed in the Promise's callback methods.

==== Usage

[source, javascript]
----
{
    "name": string,
    "type": "ScriptableFilter",
    "config": {
        "type": string,
        "file": expression, // Use either "file"
        "source": string,   // or "source", but not both.
        "args": object,
        "clientHandler": Handler reference
    }
}
----

[#d210e7927]
==== Properties
--

`"type"`: __string, required__::
The Internet media type (formerly MIME type) of the script, `"application/x-groovy"` for Groovy

`"file"`: __expression__::
Path to the file containing the script; mutually exclusive with `"source"`

+
Relative paths in the file field are relative to the base location for scripts. The base location depends on the configuration. For details, see xref:../gateway-guide/chap-install.adoc#install[Installing OpenIG] in the __Gateway Guide__.

+
The base location for Groovy scripts is on the classpath when the scripts are executed. If therefore some Groovy scripts are not in the default package, but instead have their own package names, they belong in the directory corresponding to their package name. For example, a script in package `com.example.groovy` belongs under `openig-base/scripts/groovy/com/example/groovy/`.

`"source"`: __string__::
The script as a string; mutually exclusive with `"file"`

`"args"`: __object, optional__::
Parameters passed from the configuration to the script.

+
The configuration object is a map whose values can be scalars, arrays, objects and so forth, as in the following example:
+

[source, javascript]
----
{
    "args": {
        "title": "Coffee time",
        "status": 418,
        "reason": [
            "Not Acceptable",
            "I'm a teapot",
            "Acceptable"
        ],
        "names": {
            "1": "koffie",
            "2": "kafe",
            "3": "cafe",
            "4": "kafo"
        }
    }
}
----
+
The script can then access the args parameters in the same way as other global objects. The following example sets the response status to `I'm a teapot`:
+

[source, java]
----
response.status = Status.valueOf(418, reason[1])
----
+
For details regarding this status code see RFC 7168, Section 2.3.3 link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7168#section-2.3.3[418 I'm a Teapot, window=\_blank].

+
Args parameters can reference objects defined in the heap using expressions. For example, the following excerpt shows the heap that defines `SampleFilter`:
+

[source, javascript]
----
{
    "heap": [
        {
            "name": "SampleFilter",
            "type": "SampleFilter",
            "config": {
                "name": "X-Greeting",
                "value": "Hello world"
            }
        }
    ]
}
----
+

[NOTE]
======
`SampleFilter` is a customized filter implemented as an extension of OpenIG. For information about sample filter, see xref:../gateway-guide/chap-extending.adoc#custom-sample-filter[Implementing a Customized Sample Filter] in the __Gateway Guide__.
======
+
To pass `SampleFilter` to the script, the following example uses an expression in the args parameters:
+

[source, javascript]
----
{
    "args": {
        "filter": "${heap['SampleFilter']}"
    }
}
----
+
The script can then reference `SampleFilter` as `filter`.

+
For details about the heap, see xref:required-conf.adoc#heap-objects[Heap Objects(5)].

`"clientHandler"`, __ClientHandler reference, optional__::
A Handler for making outbound HTTP requests.

+
Default: Use the default ClientHandler.

+
For details, see xref:handlers-conf.adoc#handlers-conf[Handlers].

[#SqlAttributesFilter]
=== SqlAttributesFilter — execute SQL query

[#d210e8085]
==== Description
Executes a SQL query through a prepared statement and exposes its first result. Parameters in the prepared statement are derived from expressions. The query result is exposed in an object whose location is specified by the `target` expression. If the query yields no result, then the resulting object is empty.

The execution of the query is performed lazily; it does not occur until the first attempt to access a value in the target. This defers the overhead of connection pool, network and database query processing until a value is first required. This also means that the parameters expressions is not evaluated until the object is first accessed.

[#d210e8458]
==== Example
This example intercepts the response if it is equal to 200 and executes the LoginRequestHandler. This filter might be used in a login flow where the request for the login page must go through to the target, but the response should be intercepted in order to send the login form to the application. This is typical for scenarios where there is a hidden value or cookie returned in the login page, which must be sent in the login form:

[#TokenTransformationFilter]
=== TokenTransformationFilter — transform a token issued by OpenAM to another type

[#d210e8486]
==== Description
This filter transforms a token issued by OpenAM to another token type.

The current implementation uses the REST Security Token Service (STS) APIs. It supports transforming an OpenID Connect ID Token (`id_token`) into a SAML 2.0 assertion where the subject confirmation method is Bearer, as described in link:http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-profiles-2.0-os.pdf[Profiles for the OASIS Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) V2.0, window=\_blank].

The configuration for this filter references a REST STS instance that must be set up in OpenAM before this filter can be used. The REST STS instance exposes a pre-configured transformation under a specific REST endpoint. See the OpenAM documentation for details about setting up a REST STS instance.

Any errors that occur during the token transformation cause a error response to be returned to the client and an error message to be logged for the OpenIG administrator.

[#d210e8515]
==== Properties
--

`"openamUri"`: __URL string, required__::
The base URL to an OpenAM service, such as `\https://openam.example.com:8443/openam/`.

+
Authentication and REST STS requests are made to this service.

`"realm"`: __string, optional__::
The OpenAM realm containing both the OpenAM user who can make the REST STS request and whose credentials are the username and password, and the STS instance described by the instance field.

+
Default: `/` (Top Level Realm)

`"username"`: __expression, required__::
The username for authenticating OpenIG as an OpenAM REST STS client.

+
See also xref:expressions-conf.adoc#Expressions[Expressions(5)].

`"password"`: __expression, required__::
The password for authenticating OpenIG as an OpenAM REST STS client.

+
See also xref:expressions-conf.adoc#Expressions[Expressions(5)].

`"idToken"`: __expression, required__::
An expression evaluating to OpenID Connect ID token.

+
The expected value is a string that is the JWT encoded `id_token`.

+
See also xref:expressions-conf.adoc#Expressions[Expressions(5)].

`"target"`: __expression, required__::
An expression evaluating to the location where the SAML 2.0 assertion is injected following successful transformation.

+
The value of the SAML 2.0 assertion is a string.

+
See also xref:expressions-conf.adoc#Expressions[Expressions(5)].

`"instance"`: __expression, required__::
An expression evaluating to name of the REST STS instance.

+
This expression is evaluated when the route is initialized, so the expression cannot refer to `request` or `contexts`.

+
See also xref:expressions-conf.adoc#Expressions[Expressions(5)].

`"amHandler"`: __Handler reference, optional__::
The handler to use for authentication and STS requests to OpenAM.

+
In production, use a ClientHandler that is capable of making an HTTPS connection to OpenAM.

+
Default: OpenIG uses the `ForgeRockClientHandler`.

+
See also xref:handlers-conf.adoc#handlers-conf[Handlers].

`"ssoTokenHeader"`: __string, optional__::
The name of the HTTP header to use when supplying the SSO token ID for the REST STS client subject.

+
Default: `iPlanetDirectoryPro`

==== Example
For an example of how to set up and test the token transformation filter, see xref:../gateway-guide/chap-ttf.adoc#chap-ttf[Transforming OpenID Connect ID Tokens Into SAML Assertions] in the __Gateway Guide__.

The following example uses the REST STS instance `oidc-to-saml` to request transformation of an OpenID Connect ID token into a SAML 2.0 assertion. Both the subject authenticating to access the REST endpoint, and the REST STS instance are in the realm `/sts`. The subject credentials for authentication to OpenAM are provided in the attributes context at `sts.username` and `sts.password`. The ID token to transform is provided in the attributes context at `sts.id_token`. The resulting SAML 2.0 assertion is injected as a string in the attribute context at `sts.saml_assertions`:

[#UmaFilter]
=== UmaFilter — protect access as an UMA resource server

[#d210e8720]
==== Description
This filter acts as a policy enforcement point, protecting access as a User-Managed Access (UMA) resource server. Specifically, this filter ensures that a request for protected resources includes a valid requesting party token with appropriate scopes before allowing the response to flow back to the requesting party.

[#d210e8730]
==== Usage

[source, javascript]
----
{
    "type": "UmaFilter",
    "config": {
        "protectionApiHandler": Handler reference,

==== Properties
--

`"protectionApiHandler"`: __Handler reference, required__::
The handler to use when interacting with the UMA authorization server for token introspection and permission requests, such as a ClientHandler capable of making an HTTPS connection to the server.

+
For details, see xref:handlers-conf.adoc#handlers-conf[Handlers].

`"umaService"`: __UmaService reference, required__::
The UmaService to use when protecting resources.

+
For details, see xref:misc-conf.adoc#UmaService[UmaService(5)].

`"realm"`: __string, optional__::
The UMA realm set in the response to a request for a protected resource that does not include a requesting party token enabling access to the resource.

+
Default: `uma`
